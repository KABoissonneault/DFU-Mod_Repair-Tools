Version: 1.00

DESCRIPTION:
Multiple new items have been added to the shop pool of general store shelves. The primary purpose of these items is for use as a means to repair all types of equipment and items on 
the go, without having to visit a blacksmith.

WHAT DOES THIS MOD CHANGE AND WHY?:
-Each repair tool has a different category of items it is able to repair here is a list:
1. Armorers Hammer: Plate Armor and Plate Shields from Iron to Adamantium, No Ebony, Orcish, or Daedric.
2. Jewelers Pliers: Chain Armor and Chain Shields, THIS INCLUDES RPR:I's ADDED MAIL ARMORS (Iron to Adamantium, No Ebony, Orcish, or Daedric.)
3. Sewing Kit: Clothing Items and Leather Armor and Leather Shields.
4. Whetstone: Bladed Weapons, this includes: Axes, Swords, and Short-blades.
5. Epoxy Glue: Blunt Weapons and Bows.
6. Charging Powder: Enchanted Items of all types, NOT including Artifacts and items made from Ebony, Orcish, or Daedric.

-These repair tools have different levels of rarity, so not every shop will stock the rare charging powder, and this rule applies for all the repair tools.

-Some tools are more effective when used on certain items/materials than others. The key example being Charging Powder, which is more potent on items that are more innately 
attractive to holding magical charge. This includes Silver, Dwarven, and Adamantium Items. Staves in general have great magical holding capabilities, Adamantium being the most 
potent, and various other items such as Wands, Daggers, Mages Robes, etc.

-The amount that is repaired per use of a tool is dependent on the type of tool used, as well as increased or decreased slightly by the users Luck stat.

-Use of a repair tool takes effort and therefore drains the player's stamina after being used, some tools are more strenuous to use than others, this can either be made more 
apparent depending on the endurance stat of the player.

-Repair tools CANNOT be used while enemies are nearby (just like when you can't rest) and can't be used if you are too exhausted.

-Tools have a limited durability and will eventually break from use.

-Repair tools can only repair items up to a maximum of 80% of the maximum condition value. This is to keep Black-smiths in business, you are just a DIY amateur after all, you 
need a professional to make something truly "Like New" again.
