## Description

This mod lets you work your items into a Greater Condition. It expands on the previous Repair Tools mod to overhaul how item condition works in Daggerfall. This is reflected in the following features:

- Just like Repair Tools, this mod features new items that can be found in stores that allow you to make manual repairs to your items while being out adventuring
- Manual repairs now have a progression and an economy. It's harder to repair Daedric than it is to repair Iron, but you can get better at it
- Magic items no longer rely on item condition. Instead, a separate "charge" meter has been added to each magic item, which has its own mechanics. Magic weapon and armor condition still works like normal

### Repair Tools

Multiple new items have been added to the shop pool of general store shelves. The primary purpose of these items is for use as a means to repair all types of equipment and items on 
the go, without having to visit a blacksmith.

The following tools repair an item's condition:

1. Armorer's Hammer: Plate Armor and Plate Shields from Iron to Daedric
2. Jeweler's Pliers: Chain Armor and Chain Shields, including Roleplay & Realism:Items's added mail armors (from Iron to Daedric)
3. Sewing Kit: Clothing Items, and Leather Shields and Armor, including Roleplay & Realism: Items's added fur and brigandine armors (from Iron to Daedric)
4. Whetstone: Bladed Weapons (this includes Axes, Swords, and Short blades)
5. Epoxy Glue: Blunt Weapons and Bows.

In addition, magic items now use a separate Charge meter, rather than consume item condition on use. The following tools deal with magic charge:

1. Charging Powder: Restores Charge for enchanted items of all type

#### Mechanics

- The Charging Powder is more potent on items that are more suited for magic usage. This includes Silver, Dwarven, and Adamantium Items. Staves in general have great magical holding capabilities, Adamantium being the most potent, and various other items such as Wands, Daggers, Mages Robes, etc.

- The amount that is repaired per use of a tool is dependent on the type of tool used, as well as increased or decreased slightly by the users Luck stat.

- Use of a repair tool takes effort and therefore drains the player's stamina after being used, some tools are more strenuous to use than others, this can either be made more 
apparent depending on the endurance stat of the player.

- Repair tools CANNOT be used while hostile enemies are nearby (just like when you can't rest) and can't be used if you are too exhausted.

- Tools have a limited durability and will eventually break from use.

- Repair tools can only repair items up to a certain maximum condition value. This value depends both on your ability to repair, and the material of the item. In general, stronger materials require stronger ability.

### Magic Charge

- All magic items get a magic charge, which is visible from the Inventory screen (unless you use another mod which changes the Inventory screen)

- Any time item condition would have been consumed in Daggerfall, the magic charge gets consumed instead. For Cast When Used effects, this occurs when the item is used (10 charge per use). For Cast When Strikes effects, this occurs when the weapon strikes a target (10 charge per use). For Cast When Held effects, there's an initial cost on equip based on the effect, and a slow decay over time. The decay is much slower while sleeping, and is completely stopped when fast traveling, in jail, or "tedious traveling" with Travel Options.

## COMPATIBILITY

### Roleplay Realism: Items 
The new chain mail and brigandine armors can be properly repaired by the repair tools

### Travel Options
Unlike the Daggerfall Unity formula, this mod does not consume magic charge from Cast When Held magic items while using "tedious travel" from Travel Options
